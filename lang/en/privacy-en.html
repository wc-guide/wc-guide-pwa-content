<h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>

<h3>Data protection</h3>

<p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal 
data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in 
accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this 
privacy policy.</p>

<p>If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be 
collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be 
personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we 
collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what 
purpose this happens.</p>

<p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email 
communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection 
of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>

<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3>

<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express 
consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An 
informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed 
before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>

<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>

<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for 
the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the 
inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an 
encrypted connection in your browser’s address line when it changes from
 “http://” to “https://” and the lock icon is displayed in your 
browser’s address bar.</p>

<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3>

Your information including contact data for the purpose of processing the request and in case of

revoke. For this purpose, an informal communication by e-mail to us is sufficient. The 
Legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation.

The WC-Guide is free of charge for you to use and <u>will remain so</u>. There is a lot of voluntary work behind it, but there are still costs for development and maintenance of the website.
</p>
<p>
With a donation you support the further development and continuation of this project.

<h2>Thanks a lot!</h2>

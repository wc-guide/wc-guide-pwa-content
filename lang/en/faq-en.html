	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_only">Why is there "only" the website and no more apps for iPhone and Android?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_only">
		<p>The time and money required to maintain three platforms (website, iPhone and Android app) was enormous and no longer sustainable for us, so the future of the WC-Guide became uncertain. Fortunately, the technology today is so advanced that with the help of a modern PWA website, all the functions we need can be covered by a modern browser. So only one platform is needed for all systems and the continuity of the WC-Guide is secured.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_benefit">What are the benefits of the new website, resp. PWA?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_benefit">
		<p>With the help of modern browser technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3, all required features of the WC-Guide such as location determination can be covered.</p>
		<p>A website built with these technologies and PWA behaves like a native app, and offers some advantages over a normal website, such as offline usage.</p>
		<p>Calling the website wc-guide.com and setting it up as an app is all it takes.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="info_apps_usable">Can I still use the old apps for iPhone and Android?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="info_apps_usable">
		<p>Yes and no. Currently the app still works, but it will not be further developed by us. If Apple or Google updates iOS or Android with deeper changes, the WC-Guide app may not work properly anymore. In any case, we recommend that you use the new website in your browser or as a PWA app so you're always up-to-date with the current version.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="open_data">WC-Guide and Open Data / OpenStreetMap</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="open_data">
		<p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> is a project by volunteers to collectively create a free map of the entire world. To do this, data is collected from the surrounding area about roads, facilities, shops, railways, forests, addresses, bodies of water and much more, including toilets. This data is freely available and is continuously maintained by a large community. Of course, you can also participate in OpenStreetMap and contribute to the WC-Guide.</p> <p>The WC-Guide is a free service.
		<p>The WC-Guide has been drawing its data from OpenStreetMap since February 2021, i.e. toilets around the globe are now displayed. Not all data has been taken over from the WC-Guide yet.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_electric">Are disabled toilets accessible with electric-wheelchairs?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_electric">
		<p>It would be nice, if the answer was yes. Sadly „handicapped accessible“ does not automatically imply accessibility with electric-wheelchairs. In important cases please contact thethe local information point (e.g. municipality, etc).</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_eurokey_entry">What are Eurokey toilets and how do I get a key for them?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_eurokey_entry">
		<p>Eurokey is a standardised locking system for obstacle-free facilities, including toilets, that is widely used in Europe. In Switzerland, these facilities are managed by Pro Infirmis, a specialist organisation for people with disabilities.</p><p>The key can be ordered from an <a href="https://www.eurokey.ch/en/people-with-disabilities/delivery-point.html" target="_blank">authorised drop-off point</a> or <a href="https://www.eurokey.ch/en/people-with-disabilities/order-your-eurokey-online.html" target="_blank">directly from Pro Infirmis</a> and is intended exclusively for people who have a severe mobility impairment, a visual impairment, a chronic bowel or bladder disease or are stoma carriers.

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_eurokey_info">Why can't I report any new Eurokey toilets on this website?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_eurokey_info">
		<p>Eurokey is a common locking system used throughout Europe, but facilities are managed individually by each country.</p>
<p><strong>Switzerland:</strong> Eurokey toilets are managed in Switzerland by Pro Infirmis. Pro Infirmis maintains its own directory with more detailed information than we need for the WC Guide. The data is generously made available to us by Pro Infirmis and is checked daily. New reports or corrections to Eurokey toilets in Switzerland must be reported via the <a href="https://www.eurokey.ch/en/map-of-eurokey-locations.html" target="_blank">form on the Eurokey website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rest of Europe:</strong> The facilities are managed individually by each country through an authorised organisation/dispensing point. The Eurokey toilets outside Switzerland are user or organisation registered toilets on OpenStreetMap, which are specifically tagged as Eurokey toilets. These toilets contain a special tag<strong> "centralkey" = "eurokey"</strong>. Instructions on how to enter toilets with Eurokey can be found <a href="https://docs.wc-guide.com/WC-Guide-OSM-manual-add-new-toilet-EN.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="toggle-trigger" data-trigger-for="toilets_nette_toilette">What is the “Nette Toilette”?</h3>
	<div class="toggle-target" id="toilets_nette_toilette">
		<p>“Nette Toilette” (German for "friendly toilet") is a free public toilet, provided by restaurants, bars etc.. The toilet can be used without obligation to consume in the appropriate place. The operators obtain an allowance from the local municipality for cleaning and maintenance. Originally from Germany this idea is spreading slowly also in Swiss cities.

	<div class="toggle-target" id="general_reliability">
		<p>Our website is accessible for everyone without limitations and this can result in misuse or incorrect data. Wegenerally check all entries, but this does not prevent the occasional „rotten egg“. We do not assume responsibility for any incorrect data. If you do find an incorrectly entered detail on a toilet, please use the "Failure report“-function to correct it.</p>
